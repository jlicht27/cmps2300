6) The * is used as a pointer to other variables or used to dereference
the value of the variable it is pointing to. If you create a function that
changes the values of the arguments, you need to use a * when changing the
value in the function. Without it, the program will create a temporary variable
and then change the value of the temporary variable. Additionally, the & should
be used when you want to access the memory address of a variable. When scanning
in variables, you should tell the program "assign the value to the variable
stored at this address."
